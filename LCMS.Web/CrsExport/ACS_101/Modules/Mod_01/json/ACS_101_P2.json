Josh, you're the best!<br></br>There's Barbara in Claims who got the information I needed almost immediately when I put Mrs. Smith on hold so I could check on the coverage. Love you, Barbara!<br></br>There's the Disbursements team. They're so reliable. I knew exactly when Mrs. Smith could expect to receive her benefit. Great job, guys!<br></br>None of these people spoke to Mrs. Smith, but they always provide excellent service to ME, because I'm THEIR customer. Without them, I couldn't have served her. So this award is for all of us! <br></br>Oh, I don't want to forget my manager, Joe Tuttle. He makes this place a great place to work. He gave me the training I needed for this challenging job, so I can be proud of the difference I make in people's lives.<br></br>And last but not least, Ms. Wellington, our CEO.
